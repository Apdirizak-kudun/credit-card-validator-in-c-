# Credit Card Validator Using C++

A credit card validator is a program or algorithm used to verify the validity of a credit card number. One of the most common methods for validation is the Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm. This algorithm helps determine if the credit card number entered follows a valid sequence.


    

# Here is the detailed process:

Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit), move left, double the value of every second digit.
If doubling of a digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from the product.
Sum all the digits.
If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero), then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; otherwise, it is not valid.
